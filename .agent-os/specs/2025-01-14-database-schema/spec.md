# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Database Schema Design and Implementation
> Created: 2025-01-14

## Overview

Design and implement a comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema for the B2B Influencer CRM platform. This schema will support influencer discovery, user management, campaign tracking, and pipeline attribution, providing the data foundation for all platform features.

## User Stories

### Database Foundation

As a **system architect**, I want to **design a robust database schema**, so that **all platform features have proper data persistence and relationships**.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Design tables for users, influencers, campaigns, and pipeline data
- Define proper relationships and foreign key constraints
- Implement data validation and integrity rules
- Create indexes for optimal query performance
- Set up proper data types and constraints

### User Data Management

As a **user**, I want to **have my own private workspace**, so that **my influencer data and campaigns are isolated from other users**.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Users table stores authentication and profile information
- User-specific data is properly isolated through foreign keys
- User permissions and access control are enforced at database level
- User data can be queried efficiently for dashboard views

### Influencer Discovery

As a **marketer**, I want to **search and filter through a comprehensive influencer database**, so that **I can find relevant B2B influencers quickly**.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Influencers table stores comprehensive profile information
- Searchable fields are properly indexed for fast queries
- Platform-specific data is normalized and structured
- Industry and audience data supports advanced filtering

### Campaign Tracking

As a **marketer**, I want to **track my influencer campaigns and their outcomes**, so that **I can measure ROI and optimize my strategy**.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Campaigns table links users to influencers with campaign details
- Campaign outcomes and metrics are stored and trackable
- UTM tracking data is properly structured
- Campaign history is maintained for analysis

### Pipeline Attribution

As a **marketer**, I want to **connect influencer campaigns to actual pipeline and revenue**, so that **I can prove the business impact of influencer partnerships**.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Pipeline data connects campaigns to opportunities and deals
- Attribution tracking links influencer activity to business outcomes
- Revenue data is properly calculated and stored
- Historical attribution data supports ROI analysis

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Tables Design** - Users, influencers, campaigns, pipeline, and attribution tables
2. **Relationships and Constraints** - Foreign keys, indexes, and data integrity rules
3. **Data Types and Validation** - Proper PostgreSQL data types and constraints
4. **Performance Optimization** - Indexes and query optimization strategies
5. **Mock Data Generation** - Realistic test data for development and testing
6. **Supabase Implementation** - Database creation and migration scripts

## Out of Scope

- Authentication implementation (separate spec)
- API endpoints (separate spec)
- Frontend data fetching (separate spec)
- Advanced analytics queries (separate spec)
- Data backup and recovery strategies
- Advanced security features (encryption, etc.)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Complete database schema** with all tables, relationships, and constraints
2. **Supabase migration scripts** to create the database structure
3. **Mock data generation scripts** with realistic test data
4. **Database documentation** with table descriptions and relationships
5. **Query examples** for common operations
6. **Performance recommendations** for indexes and optimization

## Technical Requirements

### Database System
- **PostgreSQL** via Supabase
- **Supabase CLI** for migrations
- **Row Level Security** for user data isolation
- **Proper indexing** for search performance

### Data Integrity
- **Foreign key constraints** for referential integrity
- **Check constraints** for data validation
- **Unique constraints** for data uniqueness
- **NOT NULL constraints** for required fields

### Performance
- **Composite indexes** for common query patterns
- **Partial indexes** for filtered queries
- **Query optimization** for dashboard and search operations
- **Connection pooling** configuration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tables created successfully in Supabase
- [ ] Relationships and constraints working properly
- [ ] Mock data populated for testing
- [ ] Query performance meets requirements
- [ ] Row Level Security properly configured
- [ ] Database documentation complete
