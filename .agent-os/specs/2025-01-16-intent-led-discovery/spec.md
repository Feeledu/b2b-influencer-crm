# Intent-Led Discovery Feature Specification

## Overview
**Feature:** Intent-Led Discovery  
**Priority:** High (Phase 1 MVP)  
**Complexity:** Large (L)  
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  

## Problem Statement
Users need to discover influencers that their target audience (ICP) already follows and engages with, rather than just finding influencers with large followings. Current discovery is based on follower count and basic demographics, missing the crucial "trust factor" that drives actual conversions.

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a marketer**, I want to see audience overlap analysis between influencers and my current customers
- **As a marketer**, I want to filter influencers by buyer alignment score to find the most relevant ones
- **As a marketer**, I want to see engagement patterns that indicate high-intent audiences
- **As a marketer**, I want to understand which influencers my competitors' customers follow

## Success Criteria
- Users can discover influencers with >70% audience overlap with their ICP
- Buyer alignment scoring accurately predicts campaign performance
