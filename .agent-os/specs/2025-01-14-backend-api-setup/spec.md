# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Backend API Setup
> Created: 2025-01-14

## Overview

Implement a FastAPI backend with Supabase integration to serve as the foundation for the B2B Influencer CRM platform. This backend will provide RESTful APIs for influencer discovery, user management, campaign tracking, and pipeline attribution, enabling the frontend to deliver the core value proposition of finding and measuring B2B influencer partnerships.

## User Stories

### Backend API Foundation

As a **frontend developer**, I want to **interact with a well-documented REST API**, so that **I can build the influencer discovery and CRM features without backend complexity**.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Frontend makes HTTP requests to FastAPI endpoints
- API returns structured JSON responses with proper error handling
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation is automatically generated and accessible
- Authentication is handled via Supabase Auth integration
- Database operations are abstracted through API endpoints

### Database Integration

As a **system architect**, I want to **connect FastAPI to Supabase PostgreSQL**, so that **data persistence and real-time capabilities are available for the influencer CRM features**.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- FastAPI connects to Supabase PostgreSQL database
- Database connection is properly configured with connection pooling
- Environment variables are used for secure configuration
- Database models are defined using SQLAlchemy or similar ORM
- Migrations are handled through Supabase or Alembic

### Authentication Integration

As a **user**, I want to **authenticate using my existing Google account or email**, so that **I can access the influencer CRM without creating another password**.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Supabase Auth is integrated with FastAPI
- JWT tokens are validated on protected endpoints
- User context is available in API routes
- CORS is properly configured for frontend domain

## Spec Scope

1. **FastAPI Application Setup** - Initialize FastAPI project with proper project structure, dependencies, and configuration
2. **Supabase Integration** - Connect to Supabase PostgreSQL database with proper connection handling and environment configuration
3. **Authentication Middleware** - Implement Supabase Auth integration with JWT token validation and user context
4. **API Documentation** - Set up automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation
5. **CORS Configuration** - Configure CORS for frontend domain access
6. **Health Check Endpoint** - Implement basic health check endpoint for monitoring

## Out of Scope

- Database schema design (separate spec)
- Specific business logic endpoints (separate specs)
- File upload functionality
- Real-time features (WebSockets)
- Advanced caching strategies
- Rate limiting implementation

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working FastAPI server** that starts successfully and responds to health check requests
2. **Supabase connection** that can perform basic database operations (tested via API endpoint)
3. **Authentication integration** that validates Supabase JWT tokens and provides user context
4. **API documentation** accessible at `/docs` endpoint with all configured routes
5. **CORS configuration** that allows frontend requests from localhost:8080
