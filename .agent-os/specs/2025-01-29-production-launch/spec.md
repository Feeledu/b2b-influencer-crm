## Overview

This specification outlines the complete setup required to launch Fluencr to production, including deployment infrastructure, testing implementation, and monitoring systems. The application is 85% ready with core functionality complete, requiring only infrastructure and quality assurance setup.

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I need automated deployment pipelines so that updates can be deployed safely and quickly
- I need comprehensive testing so that I can catch bugs before users do
- I need monitoring so that I can identify and fix issues in real-time

### As a Product Owner
- I need reliable uptime so that users can access the application when needed
- I need performance monitoring so that I can ensure good user experience
- I need error tracking so that I can prioritize bug fixes

### As a User
- I need fast loading times so that I can use the application efficiently
- I need reliable service so that my work isn't interrupted
- I need secure data handling so that my information is protected

## Spec Scope

### Deployment Infrastructure
