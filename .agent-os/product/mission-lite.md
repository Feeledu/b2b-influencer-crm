# Product Mission (Lite)

B2B Influencer CRM is the influence-to-revenue platform for B2B marketing. Find out who your buyers trust. Partner with them. Prove the impact.

B2B Influencer CRM serves marketing managers, growth leads, founder-led SaaS teams, and ops/reporting teams who struggle with the top B2B influencer marketing challenges: finding the right influencers (48% struggle), measuring results (47% struggle), and managing relationships (40% struggle). Unlike B2C-focused platforms or generic audience research tools, B2B Influencer CRM provides intent-led discovery of LinkedIn creators, podcast hosts, and newsletter writers your buyers already trust, with pipeline attribution and ROI tracking for non-trackable channels.
