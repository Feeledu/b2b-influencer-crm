# Product Mission

## Pitch

B2B Influencer CRM is a web application that helps B2B SaaS marketers find LinkedIn/podcast/newsletter influencers their buyers trust and measure how those collaborations impact leads, pipeline, and revenue.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **In-house SaaS marketers**: Marketing managers or growth leads at B2B SaaS companies who run campaigns beyond paid ads and need to show results in leads/pipeline
- **Founder-led SaaS teams**: Early-stage SaaS founders (pre-marketing hire) who want a fast way to identify influencers and see if collaborations generate demo requests without hiring an agency
- **Ops/reporting teams**: RevOps or marketing ops specialists in scaling SaaS companies who need clean reporting on influencer partnerships to integrate into HubSpot/Salesforce

### User Personas

## The Problem

### Finding the Right Influencers (48% of marketers struggle with this)

B2B marketers waste countless hours manually searching for relevant influencers across LinkedIn, podcasts, and newsletters. Unlike B2C where popularity makes influencers easy to find, B2B requires deep due diligence to validate expertise, audience alignment, and industry credibility. Marketers struggle with fragmented discovery across platforms, lack of audience demographic insights, and no way to verify if an influencer's audience actually includes their target buyers.

**Our Solution:** Preloaded, searchable database of LinkedIn creators, podcast hosts, and newsletter writers with advanced filtering by industry, audience demographics, expertise validation, and audience-buyer alignment scoring.

### Measuring and Reporting Results (47% of marketers struggle with this)

Companies can't quantify the impact of influencer collaborations on their business metrics. Current tracking is ad hoc and scattered across spreadsheets, making it impossible to measure true impact on leads, pipeline, and revenue. Without proper UTM tracking and outcome measurement, influencer marketing remains a "black box" for B2B companies.

**Our Solution:** Built-in campaign tracking with UTM generation and ROI dashboards that tie influencer activity to leads, pipeline, and revenue.

### Managing Influencer Relationships (40% of marketers struggle with this)

B2B influencer marketing requires ongoing, relationship-focused engagement rather than one-off campaigns. Marketers struggle to maintain organized contact information, track interaction history, and manage the relationship lifecycle across multiple touchpoints.

**Our Solution:** Complete CRM functionality with contact management, interaction timeline, status tracking, and file storage for campaign materials.

## Differentiators

### B2B-Only Influencer Discovery

Unlike platforms that focus on B2C creators (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) or generic audience research tools, we exclusively focus on LinkedIn creators, podcast hosts, and newsletter writers - the actual channels B2B buyers trust. This results in a search engine of trusted voices by industry vertical, focused on buyers' trust graphs rather than vanity metrics.

### Attribution to Pipeline (Not Clicks)

Unlike most influencer platforms that measure impressions, clicks, and engagements, we connect influencer partnerships directly to pipeline and revenue through CRM integrations. This results in conversion narratives that brand/content teams can use with CFOs, showing which influencer partnerships actually influenced opportunity creation and revenue.

### Intent-Led Discovery: Who Your Buyers Already Trust

Instead of guessing who to partner with, we show which creators your ideal customer profile already follows or engages with through LinkedIn engagement, newsletter opens, and podcast guest overlaps. This results in data-driven influencer selection based on who already influences your current pipeline, not just who has big reach.

### Campaign ROI Dashboard for Non-Trackable Channels

Unlike tools that rely on UTMs (which don't work for podcasts, LinkedIn posts, or newsletters), we provide "fuzzy" attribution through direct traffic uplifts, branded search spikes, and CRM engagement patterns. This results in measurable ROI for "dark social" channels that were previously impossible to track.

### Complete Workflow: Discovery → Activation → Attribution

Instead of cobbling together 6+ tools (Airtable + Clay + Google Sheets + HubSpot + Clearbit + Typeform), we offer a clean, connected workflow from influencer discovery to campaign tracking to CRM attribution. This results in a single platform that replaces manual, hacky workflows with streamlined B2B influencer marketing operations.
